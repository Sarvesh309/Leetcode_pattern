int & chars are interchangable (primitives)
Every char has an numeric ascii value associated with it.
& ints(not all) have corresponding character assigned to it

for ex:- char c = 49 valid  sout will print A
int y = 'K' valid  sout will print 75

IMP:- for recursion
The answer making base condition should always be at the top of the recursive function even before the terminating base conditions
considering the answer for current node is evaluated at next node.

Above observation is subjective to the fact that answwer evaluation for current happens at next node
because Index outof bound may arrive if terminating conditions are before the answer making ones

If the answer evaluation is at the current node, then write base condition after making the all recursive calls
ie:- at the end of the function.
