1. For Top View, Bottom View, Left View, Right View
   -> Maintain Global width max, height max, Map<Integer, List<Node>> mapping - for maintaining nodes at each level/Width

2. Maximum Width of Binary Tree :-
    -> Prerequisite:- Need to know the index formula at each level in case of Binary Tree

3. Given a Binary Tree of nodes, find all the possible paths from the root node to all the leaf nodes of the binary tree.
    -> Post-Order Traversal- return list in the recursive function

4.  Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. (2 nodes = 1 edge)
    -> Post-Order Traversal- Maintain global max_edge/max_node as well as for every Node return maximum edges from their left & right subtrees locally from recursive function.

5. Check if tree is height Balanced Binary Tree
    -> In this , we recursively find height and return if it is balanced or not

6. purely TOP-BOTTOM Approach -> Preorder Traversal
   purely BOTTOM-TOP approach -> PostOrder Traversal
   purely LEFT-RIGHT approach -> Inorder traversal

7. Left View is different from Left Boundary traversal---- left View != left Boundary
    left view may contain additional nodes which are not part of left boundary nodes

8. PreOrder -> Top-Down approach
   InOrder/PostOrder -> Bottom-Up Approach
